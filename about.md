Six of our team members are rookies to FTC and our Code, Build, Strategy, and Marketing teams are all new to these roles.Spare Parts brings a variety of skills and talents together to form a fun team focused on learning, mentoring and growth.  

Our Theme for the Skystone Season is Build… Build our team, Build the next generation and Build the future because we believe that when you bring SPARE PARTS together you can BUILD amazing things!

## Outreach Impact
We are a mostly rookie team and to go with our season theme of **BUILD** we are focusing our Youth outreach efforts on **BUILDING THE NEXT GENERATION**. Cumulatively we have spent over **500 hrs** on youth outreach to date and have many more activities planned.

This was accomplished in our robotics program, our communities and globally.

* Spare Parts mentors PopRocks robotics (three  FLL and four Jr FLL teams). 
* Spare Parts Coordinated season kickoffs for FLL, FLL jr and is organizing an FLL jr Expo in March
* We built STEM awareness at community events like Lake County Fair, and the Milwaukee Maker Faire.
* We built programs to increase female participation in STEM through Girls in First and Tech (GIFT) education programs and YMCA summer camps.
* We built STEM project boxes and sent them to Restoring Hope International Program in Guyana at the GOOD HOPE learning center
